We have succesfully constructed the modeling of project of USTC 2009 iGEM team. Due to various
reasons, the result will be shown in our final release of our software as a demo. This work could
perfectly illustrate the features of our software. It include many novel biological process, such as 
quorem sensing, multi-compartment, and cell killing to death. There are more than 100 reactions in
total, which is almost impossible to model manually, which, in turns, shows great power of our
software.

To have a first look, we provide a screenshot of the results about single compartment which contains plasmid (shown
as below)

. For more details, please run our example.
