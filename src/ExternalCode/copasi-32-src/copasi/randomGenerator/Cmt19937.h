/**
 * Cmt19937 class implementing the Mersenne Twister random number generator,
 *
 * Created for Copasi by Stefan Hoops
 *
 * A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
 * Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
 * This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
 * Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.
 *
 * Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
 * or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
