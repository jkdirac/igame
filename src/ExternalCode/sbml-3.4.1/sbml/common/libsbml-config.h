 * Some explanations about this file are warranted.  This file includes
 * one of the following (depending on operating system and compiler):
 * 
 * - <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h</tt>
 * - <tt>libsbml-config-win.h</tt>
 * 
 * On Linux, MacOS X, Cygwin, etc., <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h</tt> and
 * <tt>libsbml-package.h</tt> are generated from
 * <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h.in</tt> and <tt>libsbml-package.h.in</tt>,
 * respectively, by the @c configure script at the top level of the libSBML
 * distribution.
 * 
 * On Windows, we cannot rely on <tt>libsbml-config-win.h</tt> being
 * generated by @c configure, since most developers will not be able to run
 * @c configure in that environment.  Instead, both
 * <tt>libsbml-config-win.h</tt> and <tt>libsbml-package.h</tt> (which see)
 * are stored in the source repository and must be updated by the libSBML
 * developers as necessary.  The file <tt>libsbml-config-win.h</tt> should
 * rarely, if ever, need to be updated, while <tt>libsbml-package.h</tt>
 * should require minor updates prior to each libsbml release.  This is
 * admittedly not an ideal and fool-proof arrangement; however, at this
 * time it is the best we have been able to find under the circumstances.
 * 
 * Finally, <tt>libsbml-config.h</tt>, <tt>libsbml-package.h</tt>,
 * <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h</tt>, and (for consistency)
 * <tt>libsbml-config-win.h</tt> are all installed by @c "make install".
