 * compiled with the LIBLAX_EXPORTS symbol defined on the command line.
 * This symbol should not be defined on any project that uses this
 * DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see
 * LIBLAX_EXTERN functions as being imported from a DLL, wheras this DLL
 * sees symbols defined with this macro as being exported.
