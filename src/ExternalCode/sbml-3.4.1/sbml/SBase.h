 * @class SBase
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBase, the base class of all SBML objects.
 *
 * Most components in SBML are derived from a single abstract base type,
 * SBase.  In addition to serving as the parent class for most other
 * classes of objects in SBML, this base type is designed to allow a
 * modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each
 * major element or list in an SBML model.
 *
 * SBase has an optional subelement called "notes".  It is intended to
 * serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by
 * humans.  An example use of the "notes" element would be to contain
 * formatted user comments about the model element in which the "notes"
 * element is enclosed.  There are certain conditions on the XHTML content
 * permitted inside the "notes" element; these are described separately
 * below.
 *
 * SBase has another optional subelement called "annotation".  Whereas the
 * "notes" element described above is a container for content to be shown
 * directly to humans, the "annotation" element is a container for optional
 * software-generated content @em not meant to be shown to humans.  The
 * element's content type is XML type @c any, allowing essentially
 * arbitrary data content.  SBML places only a few restrictions on the
 * organization of the content; these are intended to help software tools
 * read and write the data as well as help reduce conflicts between
 * annotations added by different tools.  They are described separately
 * below.
 * 
 * It is worth pointing out that the "annotation" element in the definition
 * of SBase exists in order that software developers may attach optional
 * application-specific data to the elements in an SBML model.  However, it
 * is important that this facility not be misused.  In particular, it is
 * <em>critical</em> that data essential to a model definition or that can
 * be encoded in existing SBML elements is <em>not</em> stored in
 * "annotation". Parameter values, functional dependencies between model
 * elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations.  It is crucial to
 * keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely
 * ignored by software applications.  If such data affects the
 * interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly
 * impeded.
 *
 * Beginning with SBML Level 2, SBase also has an optional attribute named
 * "metaid" for supporting metadata annotations using RDF (Resource
 * Description Format). The attribute value has the data type 
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, the
 * XML identifier type, which means each "metaid" value must be globally
 * unique within an SBML file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion
 * applies across any attribute with type 
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>, not just the "metaid"
 * attribute used by SBML&mdash;something to be aware of if your
 * application-specific XML content inside the "annotation" subelement
 * happens to use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id">XML ID</a>.)
 * The "metaid" value serves to identify a model
 * component for purposes such as referencing that component from metadata
 * placed within "annotation" subelements.
 *
 * Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, SBase also has an optional
 * attribute named "sboTerm" for supporting the use of the Systems Biology
 * Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of
 * the form SBO:NNNNNNN, where NNNNNNN is a seven digit integer number;
 * libSBML simplifies the representation by only storing the NNNNNNN
 * integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the "sboTerm" attribute on SBase has
 * data type @c int, and SBO identifiers are stored simply as integers.
 * SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class of
 * SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about the
 * values permitted for "sboTerm".  Please consult the SBML Level 2 Version
 * 4 specification for more information about the use of SBO and the
 * "sboTerm" attribute.
 *
 * Finally, note that, in the list of methods on SBase, there is no public
 * constructor because SBase is an abstract class.  The constructors reside
 * in the subclasses derived from SBase.
 *
 * 
 * @section sbase-notes Requirements for the content of the "notes" subelement
 *
 * The content of "notes" elements must be in XHTML 1.0 format.  (Plain
 * HTML would not be usable because whatever appears inside the "notes"
 * element must be compatible with XML, which HTML is not, and in any case,
 * the requirement for using XHTML does not prevent users from entering
 * plain-text content ,which they can do using the standard <code>&lt;pre&gt;
 * ... &lt;/pre&gt;</code> elements of [X]HTML.)
 *
 * The XML content of a "notes" subelement must declare the use of the
 * XHTML XML namespace.  This can be done in multiple ways.  One way is to
 * place a namespace declaration for the appropriate namespace URI (which
 * for XHTML is <tt>"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</tt>) on the top-level
 * <code>sbml</code> element and then reference the namespace in the
 * "notes" element content using a prefix.  The following example
 * illustrates this approach:
 * @verbatim
<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4" level="2" version="4"
      xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  ...
  <notes>
    <xhtml:body>
      <xhtml:center><xhtml:h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</xhtml:h2></xhtml:center>
      <xhtml:p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator
      involving cyclin and cdc2 kinase</xhtml:p>
    </xhtml:body>
  </notes>
  ...
@endverbatim
 *
 * Another approach is to declare the XHTML namespace within the "notes"
 * element content itself, as in the following example:
 * @verbatim
...
<notes>
  <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

    <center><h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</h2></center>

    <p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator
    involving cyclin and cdc2 kinase</p>

  </body>
</notes>
...
@endverbatim
 *
 * The <code>xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</code> declaration on @c
 * body as shown above changes the default XML namespace within it, such
 * that all of its content is by default in the XHTML namespace.  This is a
 * particularly convenient approach because it obviates the need to prefix
 * every element with a namespace prefix (i.e., <code>xhtml:</code>
 * in the previous case).  Other approaches are also possible.
 * 
 * SBML does not require the content of the "notes" subelement to be any
 * particular XHTML element; the content can be almost any well-formed
 * XHTML content.  SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4 added some small
 * restrictions and clarifications for the allowable content in order to
 * promote greater interoperability between software tools.  The first
 * restriction comes from the requirements of XML: the "notes"
 * element must not contain an XML declaration nor a DOCTYPE declaration.
 * That is, "notes" must @em not contain
 * @verbatim
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
@endverbatim
 * nor (where the following is only one specific example of a DOCTYPE
 * declaration)
 * @verbatim
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
@endverbatim
 *
 * The second restriction is intended to balance freedom of content with
 * the complexity of implementing software that can interpret the content.
 * The content of the "notes" subelement in SBML can consist only of the
 * following possibilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A complete XHTML document (minus the XML and DOCTYPE declarations,
 * of course), that is, XHTML content beginning with the @c html tag.
 * @verbatim
<notes>
  <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
     ...
  </html>
</notes>
@endverbatim
 *
 * <li> The @c body element from an XHTML document.  The following is an
 * example skeleton:
 * @verbatim
<notes>
    <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      ...
    </body>
</notes>
@endverbatim
 *
 * <li> Any XHTML content that would be permitted within a @c body element.
 * If this consists of multiple elements, each one must declare the XML
 * namespace separately.  The following is an example fragment:
 * @verbatim
<notes>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      ...
    </p>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      ...
    </p>
</notes>
@endverbatim
 * </ul>
 *
 * Another way to summarize the restrictions above is simply to say that
 * the content of an SBML "notes" element can be only be a complete @c html
 * element, a @c body element, or whatever is permitted inside a @c body
 * element.  In practice, this does not limit in any meaningful way what
 * can be placed inside a "notes" element; for example, if an application
 * or modeler wants to put a complete XHTML page, including a @c head
 * element, it can be done by putting in everything starting with the @c
 * html container.  However, the restrictions above do make it somewhat
 * simpler to write software that can read and write the "notes" content.
 *
 * 
 * @section sbase-annotation Requirements for the content of the "annotation" subelement
 *
 * At the outset, software developers should keep in mind that multiple
 * software tools may attempt to read and write annotation content.  To
 * reduce the potential for collisions between annotations written by
 * different applications, SBML Level 2 stipulates that tools must use XML
 * namespaces to specify the intended vocabulary of every annotation.  The
 * application's developers must choose a URI (Universal Resource
 * Identifier) reference that uniquely identifies the vocabulary the
 * application will use, and a prefix string for the annotations.
 *
 * A important requirement is that application-specific annotation data is
 * entirely contained inside a single <em>top-level element</em> within the
 * SBML "annotation" subelement.  SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4 place the
 * following restrictions on annotations:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Within a given SBML "annotation" element, there can only be one
 * top-level element using a given namespace.  An annotation element can
 * contain multiple top-level elements but each must be in a different
 * namespace.
 *
 * <li> No top-level element in an "annotation" may use an SBML XML
 * namespace, either explicitly by referencing one of the SBML XML
 * namespace URIs or implicitly by failing to specify any namespace on the
 * annotation.
 *
 * <li> The ordering of top-level elements within a given "annotation"
 * element is <em>not</em> significant.  An application should not expect
 * that its annotation content appears first in the "annotation" element,
 * nor in any other particular location.  Moreover, the ordering of
 * top-level annotation elements may be changed by different applications
 * as they read and write the same SBML file.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The use of XML namespaces in this manner is intended to improve the
 * ability of multiple applications to place annotations on SBML model
 * elements with reduced risks of interference or name collisions.
 * Annotations stored by different simulation packages can therefore
 * coexist in the same model definition.  The rules governing the content
 * of "annotation" elements are designed to enable applications to easily
 * add, change, and remove their annotations from SBML elements while
 * simultaneously preserving annotations inserted by other applications
 * when mapping SBML from input to output.
 *
 * As a further simplification for developers of software and to improve
 * software interoperability, applications are only required to preserve
 * other annotations (i.e., annotations they do not recognize) when those
 * annotations are self-contained entirely within "annotation", complete
 * with namespace declarations.  The following is an example:
 * @verbatim
<annotation>
    <topLevelElement xmlns:"URI">
       ... content in the namespace identified by "URI" ...
    </topLevelElement>
</annotation>
@endverbatim
 *
 * Some more examples hopefully will make these points more clear.  The
 * next example is invalid because it contains a top-level element in the
 * SBML XML namespace&mdash;this happens because no namespace is declared
 * for the <code>&lt;cytoplasm&gt;</code> element, which means by default it
 * falls into the enclosing SBML namespace:
 * @verbatim
<annotation>
    <cytoplasm/>
</annotation>
@endverbatim
 *
 * The following example is also invalid, this time because it contains two
 * top-level elements using the same XML namespace.  Note that it does not
 * matter that these are two different top-level elements
 * (<code>&lt;nodecolors&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textcolors&gt;</code>); 
 * what matters is that these separate elements are both in the same 
 * namespace rather than having been collected and placed inside one 
 * overall container element for that namespace.
 * @verbatim
<annotation>
    <mysim:nodecolors xmlns:mysim="http://www.mysim.org/ns"
        mysim:bgcolor="green" mysim:fgcolor="white"/>
    <mysim:textcolors xmlns:mysim="http://www.mysim.org/ns"
        mysim:bgcolor="green" mysim:fgcolor="white"/>
</annotation>
@endverbatim
 *
 * On the other hand, the following example is valid:
 * @verbatim
<annotation>
    <mysim:geometry xmlns:mysim="http://www.mysim.org/ns"
             mysim:bgcolor="green" mysim:fgcolor="white">
        <graph:node xmlns:graph="http://www.graph.org/ns" 
             graph:x="4" graph:y="5" />
    </mysim:geometry>
    <othersim:icon xmlns:othersim="http://www.othersim.com/">
        WS2002
    </othersim:icon>
</annotation>
@endverbatim
 *
 * It is worth keeping in mind that although XML namespace names must be
 * URIs, they are (like all XML namespace names) <em>not required</em> to
 * be directly usable in the sense of identifying an actual, retrieval
 * document or resource on the Internet.  URIs such as
 * <code>"http://www.mysim.org/"</code> may appear as though they are
 * (e.g.) Internet addresses, but there are not the same thing.  This
 * style of URI strings, using a domain name and other parts, is only a
 * simple and commonly-used way of creating a unique name string.
 *
 *
 * @section sbase-miriam Standard format for annotations linking data resources
 *
 * SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4 define a proposed regular format for
 * encoding two particular categories of annotations: (a) references to
 * controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers which define and
 * describe biological and biochemical entities in a model; and (b)
 * descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its author(s) and
 * modification history.

   * is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition.

  /**
   * Returns the value of the "name" attribute of this object, if it has one.
   * 
   * Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: "id"
   * and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
   * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
   * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
   * label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
   * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
   * restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
   * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
   *
   * The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
   * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
   * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
   * component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
   * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
   * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
   * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
   * should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
   * language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
   * "name".)
   * 
   * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
   * generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
   * may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
   * take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
   * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
   * meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
   * form of the name attribute value.
   * 
   * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
   * allows software packages leeway in assigning component identifiers.

   * is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition.

  /**
   * Unsets the value of the "name" attribute of this SBML object.
   * 
   * Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: "id"
   * and "name".  In contrast to the "id" attribute, the "name" attribute is
   * optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing purposes
   * within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-readable
   * label for the component.  The data type of "name" is the type
   * <code>string</code> defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no
   * restrictions as to the content of "name" attributes beyond those
   * restrictions defined by the <code>string</code> type in XML Schema.
   *
   * The recommended practice for handling "name" is as follows.  If a
   * software tool has the capability for displaying the content of "name"
   * attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
   * component's label instead of the component's "id".  If the user
   * interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
   * display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the "name"
   * attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
   * should display the value of the "id" attribute instead.  (Script
   * language interpreters are especially likely to display "id" instead of
   * "name".)
   * 
   * As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
   * generate the values of "id" attributes should be aware some systems
   * may display the "id"'s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
   * take some care to have their software create "id" values that are: (a)
   * reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
   * meaningful, for example by making the "id" attribute be an abbreviated
   * form of the name attribute value.
   * 
   * An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "id" values, there are no
   * restrictions on the uniqueness of "name" values in a model.  This
   * allows software packages leeway in assigning component identifiers.
