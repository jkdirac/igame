 * @class SimpleSpeciesReference
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %SimpleSpeciesReference construct.
 *
 * As mentioned in the description of Reaction, every species that enters
 * into a given reaction must appear in that reaction's lists of reactants,
 * products and/or modifiers.  In an SBML model, all species that may
 * participate in any reaction are listed in the "listOfSpecies" element of
 * the top-level Model object.  Lists of products, reactants and modifiers
 * in Reaction objects do not introduce new species, but rather, they refer
 * back to those listed in the model's top-level "listOfSpecies".  For
 * reactants and products, the connection is made using SpeciesReference
 * objects; for modifiers, it is made using ModifierSpeciesReference
 * objects.  SimpleSpeciesReference is an abstract type that serves as the
 * parent class of both SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference.  It
 * is used simply to hold the attributes and elements that are common to
 * the latter two structures.
 *
 * The SimpleSpeciesReference structure has a mandatory attribute,
 * "species", which must be a text string conforming to the identifer
 * syntax permitted in %SBML.  This attribute is inherited by the
 * SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference subclasses derived from
 * SimpleSpeciesReference.  The value of the "species" attribute must be
 * the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing Model.  The species
 * is thereby declared as participating in the reaction being defined.  The
 * precise role of that species as a reactant, product, or modifier in the
 * reaction is determined by the subclass of SimpleSpeciesReference (i.e.,
 * either SpeciesReference or ModifierSpeciesReference) in which the
 * identifier appears.
 * 
 * SimpleSpeciesReference also contains an optional attribute, "id",
 * allowing instances to be referenced from other structures.  No SBML
 * structures currently do this; however, such structures are anticipated
 * in future SBML Levels.
 *
 * 
 * <!---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 *
 * @class SpeciesReference
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %SpeciesReference construct.
 *
 * The Reaction structure provides a way to express which species act as
 * reactants and which species act as products in a reaction.  In a given
 * reaction, references to those species acting as reactants and/or
 * products are made using instances of SpeciesReference structures in a
 * Reaction object's lists of reactants and products.
 *
 * The mandatory "species" attribute of SpeciesReference must have as its
 * value the identifier of an existing species defined in the enclosing
 * Model.  The species is thereby designated as a reactant or product in
 * the reaction.  Which one it is (i.e., reactant or product) is indicated
 * by whether the SpeciesReference appears in the Reaction's "reactant" or
 * "product" lists.
 * 
 * Product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using
 * <em>either</em> "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" in a
 * SpeciesReference object.  The "stoichiometry" attribute is of type
 * double and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
 * "stoichiometryMath" element is implemented as an element containing a
 * MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
 * "stoichiometry" or "stoichiometryMath" should be defined in a given
 * SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
 * is present, the value of "stoichiometry" in the SpeciesReference
 * instance defaults to @c 1.
 *
 * For maximum interoperability, the "stoichiometry" attribute should be
 * used in preference to "stoichiometryMath" when a species' stoichiometry
 * is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).  When the stoichiometry
 * is a rational number, or when it is a more complicated formula,
 * "stoichiometryMath" must be used.  The MathML expression in
 * "stoichiometryMath" may also refer to identifiers of entities in a model
 * (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only species identifiers
 * that can be used in "stoichiometryMath" are those referenced in the
 * Reaction list of reactants, products and modifiers.
 *
 * The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
 * X0, with stoichiometry @c 2, in a list of reactants within a reaction
 * having the identifier @c J1:
 * @code
 * <model>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfReactions>
 *         <reaction id="J1">
 *             <listOfReactants>
 *                 <speciesReference species="X0" stoichiometry="2">
 *             </listOfReactants>
 *             ...
 *         </reaction>
 *         ...
 *     </listOfReactions>
 *     ...
 * </model>
 * @endcode
 *
 * The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
 * species X0, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of the parameter
 * @c x:
 * @code
 * <model>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfReactions>
 *         <reaction id="J1">
 *             <listOfReactants>
 *                 <speciesReference species="X0">
 *                     <stoichiometryMath>
 *                         <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 *                             <ci>x</ci>
 *                         </math>
 *                     </stoichiometryMath>
 *                 </speciesReference>
 *             </listOfReactants>
 *             ...
 *         </reaction>
 *         ...
 *     </listOfReactions>
 *     ...
 * </model>
 * @endcode
 *
 * A species can occur more than once in the lists of reactants and
 * products of a given Reaction instance.  The effective stoichiometry for
 * a species in a reaction is the sum of the stoichiometry values given on
 * the SpeciesReference object in the list of products minus the sum of
 * stoichiometry values given on the SpeciesReference objects in the list
 * of reactants.  A positive value indicates the species is effectively a
 * product and a negative value indicates the species is effectively a
 * reactant.  SBML places no restrictions on the effective stoichiometry of
 * a species in a reaction; for example, it can be zero.  In the following
 * SBML fragment, the two reactions have the same effective stoichiometry
 * for all their species:
 * @code
 * <reaction id="x">
 *     <listOfReactants>
 *         <speciesReference species="a"/>
 *         <speciesReference species="a"/>
 *         <speciesReference species="b"/>
 *     </listOfReactants>
 *     <listOfProducts>
 *         <speciesReference species="c"/>
 *         <speciesReference species="b"/>
 *     </listProducts>
 * </reaction>
 * <reaction id="y">
 *     <listOfReactants>
 *         <speciesReference species="a" stoichiometry="2"/>
 *     </listOfReactants>
 *     <listOfProducts>
 *         <speciesReference species="c"/>
 *     </listProducts>
 * </reaction>
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <!---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 *
 * @class ModifierSpeciesReference
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %ModifierSpeciesReference construct.
 *
 * Sometimes a species appears in the kinetic rate formula of a reaction
 * but is itself neither created nor destroyed in that reaction (for
 * example, because it acts as a catalyst or inhibitor).  In SBML, all such
 * species are simply called @em modifiers without regard to the detailed
 * role of those species in the model.  The Reaction structure provides a
 * way to express which species act as modifiers in a given reaction.  This
 * is the purpose of the list of modifiers available in Reaction.  The list
 * contains instances of ModifierSpeciesReference structures.
 *
 * The ModifierSpeciesReference structure inherits the mandatory attribute
 * "species" and optional attributes "id" and "name" from the parent class
 * SimpleSpeciesReference.  See the description of SimpleSpeciesReference
 * for more information about these.
 *
 * The value of the "species" attribute must be the identifier of a species
 * defined in the enclosing Model; this species is designated as a modifier
 * for the current reaction.  A reaction may have any number of modifiers.
 * It is permissible for a modifier species to appear simultaneously in the
 * list of reactants and products of the same reaction where it is
 * designated as a modifier, as well as to appear in the list of reactants,
 * products and modifiers of other reactions in the model.
 *
 * 
 * <!---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 *
 * @class ListOfSpeciesReferences
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfSpeciesReferences construct.
 *
 * The ListOfSpeciesReferences class is used to store lists of reactants
 * and products in a Reaction object.
 *
 * As with the various other ListOf___ classes in %SBML, the
 * ListOfSpeciesReferences is merely a container used for organizing
 * instances of other objects, in this case SpeciesReference objects.
 * ListOfSpeciesReferences is derived from the abstract class SBase, and
 * inherit the various attributes and subelements of SBase, such as
 * "metaid" as and "annotation".  The ListOf___ classes do not add any
 * attributes of their own.
