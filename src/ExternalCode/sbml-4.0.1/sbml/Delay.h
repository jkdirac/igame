 * @class Delay
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Delay construct for %Event.
 *
 * An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
 * are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
 * effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
 * the condition which invokes it.  An event delay is defined using an
 * object of class Delay.
 *
 * The object class Delay is derived from SBase and adds a single
 * subelement called "math".  This subelement is used to hold MathML
 * content.  The mathematical formula represented by "math" must evaluate
 * to a numerical value.  It is used as the length of time between when the
 * event has @em fired and when the event's assignments are actually @em
 * executed.  If no delay is present on a given Event, a time delay of zero
 * is assumed.
 *
 * The expression in "math" must be evaluated at the time the rule is @em
 * fired.  The expression must always evaluate to a positive number
 * (otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event is
 * defined to fire before it is triggered!).
 *
 * @section delay-units The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;2 versions before Version&nbsp;4, the units of the
 * numerical value computed by the Delay's "math" expression were @em
 * required to be in units of time or the model is considered to have a
 * unit consistency error.  In Version&nbsp;4, this requirement is relaxed.
 * The Version&nbsp;4 specification only stipulates that the units of the
 * numerical value computed by a Delay instance's "math" expression @em
 * should match the model's units of time (meaning the definition of the @c
 * time units in the model).  Depending on which Version of SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 is in use, libSBML may or may not flag unit inconsistencies
 * as errors or just warnings. 
 *
 * Note that <em>units are not predefined or assumed</em> for the contents
 * of "math" in a Delay object; rather, they must be defined explicitly for
 * each instance of a Delay object in a model.  This is an important point
 * to bear in mind when literal numbers are used in delay expressions.  For
 * example, the following Event instance would result in a warning logged
 * by SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() about the fact that libSBML cannot
 * verify the consistency of the units of the expression.  The reason is
 * that the formula inside the "math" element does not have any declared
 * units, whereas what is expected in this context is units of time:
 * @code
 * <model>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfEvents>
 *         <event>
 *             ...
 *             <delay>
 *                 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 *                     <cn> 1 </cn>
 *                 </math>
 *             </delay>
 *             ...
 *         </event>
 *     </listOfEvents>
 *     ...
 * </model>
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The <code>&lt;cn&gt; 1 &lt;/cn&gt;</code> within the mathematical formula
 * of the @c delay above has <em>no units declared</em>.  To make the
 * expression have the needed units of time, literal numbers should be
 * avoided in favor of defining Parameter objects for each quantity, and
 * declaring units for the Parameter values.  The following fragment of
 * SBML illustrates this approach:
 * @code
 * <model>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfParameters>
 *         <parameter id="transcriptionDelay" value="10" units="time"/>
 *     </listOfParameters>
 *     ...
 *     <listOfEvents>
 *         <event>
 *             ...
 *             <delay>
 *                 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
 *                     <ci> transcriptionDelay </ci>
 *                 </math>
 *             </delay>
 *             ...
 *         </event>
 *     </listOfEvents>
 *     ...
 * </model>
 * @endcode
