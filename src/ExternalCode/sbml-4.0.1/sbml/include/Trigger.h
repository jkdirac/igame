 * @class Trigger
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of %SBML's %Trigger construct for %Event.
 *
 * An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
 * are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
 * Trigger construct in SBML is used to define a mathematical expression
 * that determines when an Event @em fires.
 *
 * A Trigger contains one subelement named "math" containing a MathML
 * expression.  The expression must evaluate to a value of type @c boolean.
 * The exact moment at which the expression evaluates to @c true is the
 * time point when the Event is @em fired.
 * 
 * An event only fires when its Trigger expression makes the transition in
 * value from @c false to @c true.  The event will also fire at any future
 * time points when the trigger expression makes this transition; in other
 * words, an event can fire multiple times during a simulation if its
 * trigger condition makes the transition from @c false to @c true more
 * than once.
 * 
 * An important question is whether an event can fire prior to, or at,
 * initial simulation time, that is <em>t &lt; 0</em>.  The answer is no:
 * an event can only be triggered immediately after initial simulation time
 * i.e., <em>t &gt; 0</em>.
 *
 * @see Event
 * @see Delay
 * @see EventAssignment
