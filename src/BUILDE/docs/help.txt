About iGame
    To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen,
our team is devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing
non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm
in which players help solve scientific problems, we apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities
to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed
for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment
in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and
generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose
the Standard Biological Parts Automatic Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of
complicated biological processes. Additionally, previous iGEM project models will be featured to
demonstrate the availability of our idea.


Introduction step by step
1 Before getting start
Extract the tar, cd "path/igame/bin" and find the execute file igameMain, launch it! You need to load the 
database input file into db at the first run. Launch the igameUiMain execute file, push the "Load db" 
button, select the "path/igame/beta" directory, then confirm the selection. Push the "Get Started" button 
to get start!
